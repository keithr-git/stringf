Stringf is a type-safe C++ library that provides string formatting with an interface very similar to the familiar printf() family of functions,  It is as efficient as the printf family (no extra memory allocations or data copying) and benchmarks faster in some cases.  User-defined types are supported, and new format specifies can be defined (e.g. %i for IP address).  Output can be to a char or wchar\_t array, a std::string, a stdio FILE pointer, or a std::ostream, and user-defined output types can be added.  All printf formatting options are supported, including numbered arguments (e.g. %2$d).

Stringf uses the Boost.Preprocessor and Boost.MPL libraries, and has a default limit of 20 arguments (not counting the format string and destination arguments).  The limit can be raised to a maximum of 50 if needed.  These limits come from the boost libraries.
